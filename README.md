# Esg_scoring using Thompson-Reuters data, and enhancing it. 

In this project our reference universe will correspond to all authorized stocks within the **Natixis Investment Managers Challenge, 2021 edition**. It comprises over **2,000 companies** for which we retrieved ESG data for year 2020. 
  
 
Our goal is to use **Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR)** metrics to perform clustering on these companies without using Refinitiv's own notation. Ultimately, we would like to build our own explainable score for the data.
