The authors analyze two relatively hightracking-error global strategies constructed using ESG data{\textemdash}a tilt strategy and a momentum strategy and find that both model portfolios outperformed the MSCI World Index over the past eight years, while also improving the ESG profile of the portfolios. These backtested model portfolios provide an example of how institutional investors with the tolerance to take some active risk, while at the same time looking to improve the ESG profile of their portfolios on a systematic basis, can incorporate such strategies in their investment processes.},

abstract = {We examine the effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on the cost of equity capital for a large sample of US firms. Using several approaches to estimate firms’ ex ante cost of equity, we find that firms with better CSR scores exhibit cheaper equity financing. In particular, our findings suggest that investment in improving responsible employee relations, environmental policies, and product strategies contributes substantially to reducing firms’ cost of equity. Our results also show that participation in two “sin” industries, namely, tobacco and nuclear power, increases firms’ cost of equity. These findings support arguments in the literature that firms with socially responsible practices have higher valuation and lower risk.}
